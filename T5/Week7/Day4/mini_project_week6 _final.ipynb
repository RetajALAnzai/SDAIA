        " An automated system for detecting red-light traffic violations has been developed, which could play a significant role in transportation management within smart cities. The system primarily relies on modern computer vision techniques and was implemented using the OpenCV library in a Python environment. It mainly consists of an object detector and tracker that work together to accurately maintain the positions of existing vehicles. The primary objective of the system is to identify and mark the locations of vehicles that violate traffic signals. The results demonstrated high accuracy, with all violating vehicles being detected and precisely distinguished.\n",
